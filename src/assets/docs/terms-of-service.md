These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Egibi platform operated by Egibi LLC ("Egibi," "we," "us," or "our"). By creating an account or using the platform, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the platform.

## 1. Description of Services

Egibi provides a multi-asset algorithmic trading platform that allows users to:

- Connect cryptocurrency exchange accounts via API credentials
- Design and configure trading strategies using technical indicators and rule-based logic
- Run backtests against historical market data
- Link bank accounts as funding sources through Plaid and Mercury integrations
- Monitor account balances and trading activity

Egibi is a software tool that facilitates your interaction with third-party exchanges and financial services. Egibi does not hold, custody, or manage your funds directly.

## 2. Eligibility

You must be at least 18 years of age to use the Egibi platform. By creating an account, you represent and warrant that you meet this age requirement and have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms. You are responsible for ensuring that your use of the platform complies with all laws and regulations applicable to you, including any regulations governing cryptocurrency trading in your jurisdiction.

## 3. Account Registration and Security

### 3.1 Account Creation

You must provide accurate and complete information when creating an account. You agree to keep your account information current and accurate.

### 3.2 Account Security

You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials, including your password and any exchange API keys you provide. You agree to notify us immediately if you become aware of any unauthorized access to your account. Egibi is not liable for any loss or damage arising from unauthorized access to your account that results from your failure to safeguard your credentials.

### 3.3 One Account Per Person

Each user may maintain only one account. Creating multiple accounts may result in suspension or termination of all associated accounts.

## 4. Exchange API Credentials

### 4.1 Your Responsibility

When you provide exchange API credentials to the platform, you represent that you are the authorized holder of those credentials and that you have the right to authorize Egibi to use them on your behalf. You are responsible for configuring appropriate API key permissions on your exchange accounts.

### 4.2 Recommended Permissions

We strongly recommend that API keys provided to Egibi be configured with the minimum permissions necessary for your intended use and that withdrawal permissions be disabled. Egibi is not responsible for losses resulting from overly permissive API key configurations.

### 4.3 Credential Security

Egibi encrypts your API credentials at rest using AES-256-GCM encryption. However, you acknowledge that no system is completely secure, and you provide credentials at your own risk.

## 5. Linked Bank Accounts and Funding Sources

### 5.1 Plaid Integration

When you choose to link a bank account through Plaid, you authorize Egibi to access your account and routing numbers and balance information through Plaid's services. Your use of Plaid is also subject to [Plaid's End User Privacy Policy](https://plaid.com/legal/#end-user-privacy-policy).

### 5.2 Mercury Integration

If you connect a Mercury business bank account, you authorize Egibi to retrieve account balance and identification information through Mercury's API.

### 5.3 No Fund Transfers by Egibi

Egibi does not initiate transfers, withdrawals, or deposits to or from your linked bank accounts. Bank account connections are used solely for informational purposes (viewing balances and account identifiers).

## 6. Trading and Financial Disclaimer

### 6.1 Not Financial Advice

Egibi is a software platform. Nothing on the platform constitutes financial advice, investment advice, trading advice, or any other sort of professional advice. You are solely responsible for your own trading decisions.

### 6.2 Trading Risks

Cryptocurrency trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for all individuals. Past backtest performance does not guarantee future results. Market conditions, exchange outages, API rate limits, network latency, and other factors may cause actual trading results to differ materially from backtested results.

### 6.3 No Guarantee of Performance

Egibi does not guarantee the availability, accuracy, or timeliness of data received from exchanges or other third-party services. Egibi is not responsible for losses caused by exchange downtime, incorrect market data, API failures, or delays in trade execution.

### 6.4 Your Responsibility

You acknowledge that all trading activity conducted through the platform is initiated by you (or by strategies you have configured and activated). You are fully responsible for any profits or losses resulting from trades executed through the platform.

## 7. Acceptable Use

- Violate any applicable law, regulation, or third-party rights

### 12.3 Effect of Termination

Upon termination, your right to use the platform ceases immediately. Any provisions of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination will survive, including Sections 6, 10, 11, and 14.

## 13. Modifications to Terms

We may revise these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you through the platform or by email at least 14 days before the changes take effect. Your continued use of the platform after the effective date of revised Terms constitutes your acceptance of those Terms.

## 14. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Alabama, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any dispute arising from or relating to these Terms or the platform shall be resolved exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Mobile County, Alabama, and you consent to the personal jurisdiction of those courts.

## 15. Severability

If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

## 16. Entire Agreement
